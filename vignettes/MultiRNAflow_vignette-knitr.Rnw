\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Context}\label{sec:context}

In eukaryotic cells, genes are expressed in the form of RNA molecules (transcription) which are then translated into proteins with a cellular function. In resting cells, at the steady state, transcription is affected by stochastic phenomena generating a transcriptional noise within cells. After modification of the cellular environment (cellular stress, receptor activation), hundreds of genes are activated, inducing a dynamic temporal transcriptional response allowing an adapted response of the cells to the initial modification of the environment \cite{Yosef2013GRNdynamicPerturbation}. Alterations in these temporal transcriptional responses are at the origin of pathologies (infection, cancer) and are extensively studied by biologists \cite{BarJoseph2012DynamicBiologicalProcesses} through sometimes complex experimental designs.

Recent technological developments now make it possible to quantify the transcription of all genes in the genome by sequencing RNA molecules (RNAseq). These analyses generate raw count data whose properties (discrete data) are different from the fluorescence intensity data (continuous data) generated by previous microarray techniques. These data are presented as a table reporting, for each sample, the number of reads for each gene, obtained from the alignment of collected RNA transcripts to a reference genome (or transcriptome). The raw count of a gene (or transcript) corresponds to the number of reads mapped to the RNA sequence of this gene (or transcript).

Experimental or systematic errors may occur during sequencing (uncertainty on sequencing depth, effective library sizes, ...), which require the transformation of the original raw counts.\newline
The first methods developed consist to compute either count per million (CPM) or reads per kilobase of transcripts per million reads mapped (RPKM) \cite{Mortazavi2008QuantifyingTranscriptomesRNAseq} or transcripts per million (TPM) \cite{Li2010TPM,Wagner2012TPM} as they were supposed to be a good measure of RNA molar concentration (RMC) of a transcript in a sample. Although the previous methods are useful for comparing gene expressions within a sample, as they represent the relative abundance of a gene or transcript in a sample, they should not be used for comparison between samples \cite{Zhao2020MisuseTPMRPKM,Wagner2012TPM} above all if samples belong to different biological conditions and/or time points.\newline
New methods of normalization have been developed in order to be able both to compare gene expression within a sample and gene expression between samples which belong to different biological conditions and/or time points. These methods of normalization, ensure that differences between samples are only due to their membership to different biological conditions and/or time points. The most used R package for normalization are DESeq2 \cite{Love2014DESeq2} and EdgeR \cite{Robinson2010edgeR}.

The main goals of normalization of raw counts data are both to allow for unsupervised analysis of data (within samples or between samples) and to compare gene reads in different biological condition and/or time points, to detect so-called \textbf{Differentially Expressed} (DE) genes.

\clearpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{State of the art}\label{sec:stateart}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Several R packages propose tools to normalize data, find DE genes and realize unsupervised analysis, such as IDEAL \cite{Marini2020IDEAL}, RNASeqR \cite{Chao2021RNASeqR}, GEO2RNAseq \cite{Seelbinder2019GEO2RNAseq} and RNAflow \cite{Lataretu2020RNAflow}.

These packages use the package DESeq2 and/or the package EdgedR in order to realize the normalization and the DE analysis. They can all detect DE genes in the case where samples belong to different biological conditions, although RNASeqR is limited to only two biological conditions.

These packages were not designed to deal with temporal data, although they could be adapted to this situation. However, none of them can analyse RNA-seq data with both several time points and several biological conditions. The package IDEAL allows to study more than two biological conditions but all the other packages are restricted only to two biological conditions.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Our R package MultiRNAflow}\label{sec:DescriptionPackage}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Our R package MultiRNAflow, built from the R package DESeq2 \cite{Love2014DESeq2}, provides an easy to use unified framework allowing to automatically make both unsupervised and supervised (DE) analysis for datasets with an arbitrary number of biological conditions and time points. Specifically, our package realizes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Exploratory (unsupervised) analyses of the data.
\item Statistical (supervised) analysis of transcriptional response (differentially expressed (DE) genes).
\item Analysis of temporal expression profiles of DE genes from different groups.
\item Functional analysis of temporal expression clusters.
\end{enumerate}

In particular, our code makes a deep downstream analysis of DE information, e.g. identifying temporal patterns across biological conditions and DE genes which are specific to a biological condition for each time.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Supported dataset}\label{sec:dataset}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our package takes as input a transcriptional dataset with an experimental design that includes multiple groups of individuals and/or multiple times, t0 (reference time) and ti (1 $\leq$ i $\leq$ n). The dataset is a table of raw counts where lines correspond to genes and columns correspond to samples. Each sample show the raw counts of an individual sequencing, corresponding to a biological condition, an individual sampling in this biological condition and a time.

In this document, we will illustrate the use of our package on four examples of datasets
(see section \nameref{sec:DatasetPackage}) belonging to three cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case 1}. Samples belong to different biological conditions.
\item \textbf{Case 2}. Measures were realized at different time points.
\item \textbf{Case 3}. Samples belong to different biological conditions and measures were realized at different time points.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steps of the algorithm}\label{sec:stepsalgo}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.75\textheight]{MultiRNAflowImage/MultiRNAflow_Figure.pdf}
\caption{Outputs from the package with a dataset containing several biological conditions and several time points. The experimental design is shown in (A). Exploratory analysis includes 3D PCA (B), temporal clustering of gene expression (C) and detailed temporal gene expression (D). Supervised statistical analysis (analysis map shown in (E)) include DE genes between each time and the reference time for each biological condition (F and G); specific DE genes for each biological condition at each time (H) or at at least one time (I); signature DE genes or each biological condition and each time (J). GO enrichment analysis is realized with the R package gprofiler2 (K) or by generating input files for several GO software programs, such as Webgestalt (L) or GSEA (M).}
\label{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}
\end{figure}

The package MultiRNAflow realizes the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item Normalization, realized with the R package DESeq2 \cite{Love2014DESeq2}.
\item Exploratory data analysis (unsupervised) which includes
\begin{itemize}
\item Visualization of individual patterns using factorial analysis with the R package FactoMineR \cite{Le2008FactoMineR}.
\item Visualization of biological conditions and/or temporal clusters with the R package ComplexHeatmap \cite{Gu2016ComplexHeatmaps}
\item Visualization of groups of genes with similar temporal behavior with the R package Mfuzz \cite{Futschik2005SoftClusteringMicroarray,Kumar2007Mfuzz}
\end{itemize}
\item Statistical analysis (supervised) of the transcriptional response of different groups of individuals over time with the R package DESeq2 \cite{Love2014DESeq2}, which includes
\begin{itemize}
\item Temporal statistical analysis
\item Statistical analysis by group
\item Combination of temporal and group statistical analysis
\item Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the R package GO enrichment with gprofiler2 \cite{Kolberg2020gprofiler2} (Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.K), and automatically generates outputs that can be implemented in DAVID \cite{Sherman2021DAVID}, Webgestalt \cite{Liao2019WebGestalt} (Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.L) and GSEA \cite{Subramanian2005GSEA} (Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.M) for further analysis using these databases.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


Below, we will give a short description of each of these steps before a full description of the package outputs for four examples of datasets. The following figure illustrates the short description below. It gathers a selection of graphs produced by our package for the \nameref{sec:dataWeger2021} \cite{Weger2021TemporalMouseLiver} in \textbf{case 3}. The experimental design is shown in Figure\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.A and Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.E. The authors analyzed the role of invalidation (ko) of two genes (Bmal1 and Cry1\slash{2}) on murine transcriptional dynamics over the course of the day (4 groups (Bmal1 ko (invalidated gene), Bmal1 wt (wild type, not invalidated), Cry1{\slash}2 ko, Cr1\slash{2} wt) $\times$ 4 individuals per group $\times$ 6 times $=$ 48 transcriptional time points) (Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.A).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Normalization}\label{sec:stepsnormalization}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The function \textbf{DATAnormalization()} of our package allows to realize the three methods of normalization proposed in DESeq2, which must always be performed on raw counts:


\begin{itemize}
\item Relative log expression (rle) \cite{Anders2010SizeFactorVST}. Each column of the raw counts is scaled by a specific scalar called size factors, estimated using the "median ratio method".
\item Regularized logarithm (rlog) \cite{Love2014DESeq2}. This method of normalization transforms the count data to the log2 scale in a way which minimizes differences between samples for rows (so genes) with small counts. This transformation removes the dependence of the variance on the mean, particularly the high variance of the logarithm of count data when the mean is low. This method of normalization is realized by the r function \texttt{rlog()} of the R package DESeq2.
\item Variance Stabilizing Transformation (vst) \cite{Anders2010SizeFactorVST}. This method of normalization is similar to the rlog normalization. The vst normalization is faster but the rlog normalization is more robust in the case when the size factors vary widely. This method of normalization is realized by the r function \texttt{vst()} of the R package DESeq2.
\end{itemize}

As mentioned in the DESeq2 manual, the rle transformation is used to realize DE analysis and the rlog and vst transformations are advised for unsupervised analysis (factorial analysis, clustering) or other machine learning methods.

In addition, the function \textbf{DATAnormalization()} allows to plot the distribution of normalized read counts for each sample using boxplots.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Exploratory data analysis (unsupervised)}\label{sec:stepsPCAhcpc}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsubsection{Factorial analysis}\label{sec:stepsPCA}

Factorial analysis is realized by the two functions \textbf{PCAanalysis()} and \textbf{HCPCanalysis()} which implement two methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustering on Principle Components (HCPC). The two methods allow to visualize the temporal evolution of the transcription within each group of individuals and similarities or differences in transcriptional behaviors between groups.
Of note, the PCA visualization is optimized thanks to the dynamic 3D PCA (see Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.B) allowing several viewing angles.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case 1}. In the PCA graphs, samples are colored according to biological condition.
\item \textbf{Case 2}. In the PCA graphs, consecutive time points within a sample are linked to help visualization of temporal patterns.
\item \textbf{Case 3}. The PCA graphs combine the two previous displayings.
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsubsection{Visualization of groups of genes with similar temporal behavior}
\label{sec:stepsMFUZZ}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The R function \textbf{MFUZZanalysis()} allows, in \textbf{cases 2} and \textbf{cases 3}, to find the most common temporal behavior among all genes and all individuals in a given biological condition. This is done using the R package Mfuzz \cite{Futschik2005SoftClusteringMicroarray,Kumar2007Mfuzz} based on soft clustering.
When there are several replicates per time, the Mfuzz package realizes soft clustering from the mean expression per time for each gene (see Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.C). When there are several biological conditions, the algorithm realizes the Mfuzz analysis for each biological condition.

As in any clustering method, we need to find out the optimal number of clusters. Although a method is already implemented in the Mfuzz package, this method seems to fail when the number of genes is too big. Our function \textbf{MFUZZclusternumber()} finds the optimal number of cluster using kmeans, from the package R stats \cite{Rteam2021R} or HCPC. Among the outputs, \textbf{MFUZZclusternumber()} returns

\begin{itemize}
\item a graph indicating the selected number of clusters for each biological condition
\item the results of the soft clustering for each biological condition
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsubsection{Visualization of the data}\label{sec:stepsTemporalExpr}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The R function \textbf{DATAplotExpressionGenes()} allows to plot gene expression profiles according to time and/or biological conditions (see Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.D).
The user can either use raw counts data or normalized data.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Case 1}. The output is a graph where are plotted: a box plot, a violin plot, and error bars (standard deviation) for each biological condition.
\item \textbf{Case 2}. The output is a graph where are plotted: the evolution of the expression of each replicate across time (red lines) and the evolution of the mean and the standard deviation of the expression across time (black lines).
\item \textbf{Case 3}. The output is a graph where are plotted: the evolution of the mean and the standard deviation of the expression across time for each biological condition.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Statistical analysis of the transcriptional response of different groups of individuals over time}
\label{sec:SupervisedStatisticalAnalysis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsubsection{Differentially expressed (DE) genes with DESeq2}\label{sec:stepsDE}

The function \textbf{DEanalysisGlobal()} detects DE genes.

\textbf{Case 1}. Our algorithm search for differentially expressed (DE) genes between all pairs of biological conditions.
This allows in particular to determine which genes are specific to each biological condition. A gene is called specific to a biological condition BC, if the gene is DE between BC and any other biological conditions, but not DE between any pairs of other biological conditions.\newline
Among the outputs, \textbf{DEanalysisGlobal()} returns

\begin{itemize}
\item a Venn barplot which gives the number of genes for each possible intersection. We consider that a set of pairs of biological conditions forms an intersection if there is at least one gene which is DE for each of these pairs of biological conditions, but not for the others.
\item a barplot which gives the number of specific (and over- and under-expressed, also often called up- and down-regulated) genes per biological condition.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Case 2}. Our algorithm looks for differentially expressed genes between each time ti (1$\leq i\leq n$) and the reference time t0.\newline
Among the outputs, \textbf{DEanalysisGlobal()} returns

\begin{itemize}
\item an alluvial graph of differentially expressed (DE) genes.
\item a Venn barplot which gives the number of genes per temporal pattern. By temporal pattern, we mean the set of times ti such that the gene is DE between ti and the reference time t0.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Case 3}. Our algorithm realizes a mix of the two previous cases. First, for each biological condition, the algorithm realizes \textbf{Case 2}. Then for each time, the algorithm realizes \textbf{Case 1}. We then can find specific genes.
A gene is called specific to a biological condition BC at a time ti, if the gene is DE between BC and any other biological conditions at time ti, but not DE between any pairs of other biological conditions at time ti. The algorithm also finds signature genes: a gene is called signature of a biological condition BC at a given time ti if the gene is specific for BC at time ti and DE between ti versus t0 for BC.

Among the outputs, \textbf{DEanalysisGlobal()} returns

\begin{itemize}
\item An alluvial graph of differentially expressed (DE) genes, for each biological condition (see Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.G).
\item A barplot which gives the number of DE genes per time, for each biological condition (see Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.F).
\item A barplot which gives the number of specific genes for each biological condition, one per time (see Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.H).
\item An alluvial graph of genes which are specific at at least one time, for each biological condition (see Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.I).
\item A graph which gives for each biological condition, the number of signature genes and non signatures genes per time ti versus the reference time t0 (see Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.J).
\end{itemize}


\subsubsubsection{Heatmaps, ration intensity (MA) plots and volcano plots}\label{sec:stepsVolMAheat}

Clustering of samples versus genes (heatmap, not shown) allows visualization of correlations between gene expressions according to biological conditions or times. Clustering of samples versus samples allows visualization of correlations between individuals and groups.
As there usually are to many genes in a dataset, the heatmaps are realized after the supervised analysis in order to reduce the number of genes for the heatmap.

\clearpage

\subsubsubsection{Gene ontology and gene enrichment}\label{sec:stepsGO}

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis is a technique for interpreting DE genes through the Gene Ontology system of classification. The goal is to retrieve a functional profile of DE genes and better understand the underlying biological processes. We recommend the most used online tools and software: GSEA \cite{Subramanian2005GSEA}, DAVID \cite{Sherman2021DAVID}, WebGestalt \cite{Liao2019WebGestalt}, g:Profiler \cite{Raudvere2019gProfiler}, Panther \cite{Thomas2020PANTHER}, ShinyGO \cite{GE2020ShinyGO}, Enrichr \cite{Kuleshov2016Enrichr} and GOrilla \cite{Eden2009GOrilla}.

Each of these softwares and online tools requires specific input files in order to realize their analysis. The R function \textbf{GSEApreprocessing()} automatically creates all required files.
Alternatively, the function \textbf{GSEAquickAnalysis()} provides a GSEA analysis with the R package gprofiler2 \cite{Kolberg2020gprofiler2}. Among the ouputs, \textbf{GSEAquickAnalysis()} returns

\begin{itemize}
\item A Manhattan plot ranking all GO names according to their pvalue.
\item A lollipop graph showing the most important Gene Ontologies ranked by their \newline $-\log_{10}(\mbox{pvalue})$.
\item All genes associated to all GO names.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.L and Figure~\ref{fig:ApllicationNoteImage}.M were produced by the online tool WebGestalt and the software GSEA.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Dataset used as examples in the package}
\label{sec:DatasetPackage}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In order to explain the use of each function in our package, we use four datasets.

\subsubsection{Mouse dataset 1}\label{sec:dataAntoszewski2022}

The \textbf{Mouse dataset 1} \cite{Antoszewski2022TcellNotch1} is accessible on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the accession number GSE169116.

This dataset contains the transcription profile of 12 mice belonging to 4 biological conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item 3 mice with wild type Notch1 and wild type Tcf1
\item 3 mice with wild type Notch1 and Tcf1 knocked-down
\item 3 mice with Notch1 induced and wild type Tcf1
\item 3 mice with Notch1 induced and Tcf1 knocked-down.
\end{itemize}


The dataset contains temporal expression data of 39017 genes. Notch1 is a well-established lineage specifier for T cells and among the most frequently mutated genes throughout all subclasses of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia \cite{Antoszewski2022TcellNotch1}.

To illustrate the use of our package in \textbf{case 1}, we selected 500 genes giving a representative sample of each DE profile across biological conditions, in particular genes that are specific to each biological condition.\newline
This sub dataset is saved in the file \textbf{RawCounts\_Antoszewski2022\_MOUSEsub500}.

\subsubsection{Fission dataset}\label{sec:dataLeong2014}

The \textbf{Fission dataset} \cite{Leong2014FissionOsmoticStress} is accessible on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the accession number GSE56761.
The dataset can also be obtained with the R package "fission" \cite{Leong2014FissionOsmoticStress}.

This dataset contains the temporal transcription profile of 18 wild type fission yeasts (wt) and 18 fission yeasts where atf1 is knocked-out (mut), hence 36 samples. The dataset contains temporal expression data of 7039 genes. Data were collected 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after an osmotic stress. The gene atf1 codes for a transcription factor which alters sensitivity to oxidative stress.

To illustrate the use of our package in \textbf{case 2}, we focus on the biological condition wt and select 500 genes giving a representative sample of each temporal DE profile in this biological condition.
This sub dataset is saved in the file \textbf{RawCounts\_Leong2014\_FISSIONsub500wt}.

\subsubsection{Leukemia dataset}\label{sec:dataSchleiss2021}

The \textbf{Leukemia data} \cite{Schleiss2021LeukProliferation} is accessible on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the accession number GSE130385.

This dataset contains the temporal transcription profile of 3 Proliferating (P) and 3 Non Proliferating (NP) primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cells samples. Data were collected at 0, 1h, 1h30, 3h30, 6h30, 12h, 24h, 48h and 96h after cell stimulation (so $(3+3)\times 9 = 54$ samples in total). The latest time point corresponds to the emergence of the proliferation clusters.
The dataset contains temporal expression data of 25369 genes.

To illustrate the use of our package in \textbf{case 3} with two biological conditions, we selected 500 genes giving a representative sample of each DE profile across time and biological conditions, in particular genes that are signature genes of each biological condition.
This sub dataset is saved in the file \textbf{RawCounts\_Schleiss2021\_CLLsub500}.

\subsubsection{Mouse data 2}\label{sec:dataWeger2021}

The \textbf{Mouse dataset 2} \cite{Weger2021TemporalMouseLiver} is accessible on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the accession number GSE135898.

This dataset contains the temporal transcription profile of 16 mice with Bmal1 and Cry1{\slash}2 knocked-down under an ad libitum (AL) or night restricted feeding (RF) regimen. Data were collected at 0, 4h, 8h, 16, 20h and 24h. Therefore, there are six time points and eight biological conditions. As there are only two mice per biological condition, we decided not to take into account the effect of the regimen. The dataset contains temporal expression data of 40327 genes.

To illustrate the use of our package in \textbf{case 3} with more than two biological conditions,
we take 500 genes, over the global 40327 genes in the original dataset.
This sub dataset is saved in the file \textbf{RawCounts\_Weger2021\_MOUSEsub500}.

\end{itemize}
%
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Load of the dataset}\label{sec:LoadDataset}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If the user wants to use our package with in one of the dataset included in MultiRNAflow, the user must first write in the R console either

<<LoadMus1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
data("RawCounts_Antoszewski2022_MOUSEsub500")
@

in order to load the \nameref{sec:dataAntoszewski2022}, either

<<LoadFission, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
data("RawCounts_Leong2014_FISSIONsub500wt")
@

in order to load the \nameref{sec:dataLeong2014}, either

<<LoadLeuk, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
data("RawCounts_Schleiss2021_CLLsub500")
@

in order to load the \nameref{sec:dataSchleiss2021}, either

<<LoadMus2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
data("RawCounts_Weger2021_MOUSEsub500")
@

in order to load the \nameref{sec:dataWeger2021}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Structure of the dataset}\label{sec:StructureDataset}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The dataset must be a data.frame containing raw counts data.
If it is not the case, the functions \textbf{DATAnormalization()} and \textbf{DEanalysisGlobal()} will stop and print an error.
Each line should correspond to a gene, each column to a sample, except a particular column that may contain strings of characters describing the names of the genes.
The first line of the data.frame should contain the names of the columns (strings of characters) that must have the following structure.

<<ColnamesExample, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
data("RawCounts_Leong2014_FISSIONsub500wt")
colnames(RawCounts_Leong2014_FISSIONsub500wt)
@

In this example, "Gene" indicates the column which contains the names of the different genes.
The other column names contain all kind of information about the sample, including the biological condition, the time of measurement and the name of the individual (e.g patient, replicate, mouse, yeasts culture...).
Other kinds of information can be stored in the column names (such as patient information), but they will not be used by the package.
The various information in the column names must be separated by underscores.
The order of these information is arbitrary but must be the same for all columns.
For instance, the sample "wt\_t0\_r1" corresponds to the first replicate (r1) of the wild type yeast (wt) at time t0 (reference time).\newline

The information located to the left of the first underscore will be considered to be in position 1, the information located between the first underscore and the second one will be considered to be in position 2, and so on. In the previous example, the biological condition is in position 1, the time is in position 2 and the replicate is in position 3.\newline

In most of the functions of our package, the order of the previous information in the column names will be indicated with the inputs \texttt{Group.position}, \texttt{Time.position} and \texttt{Individual.position}. Similarly the input \texttt{Column.gene} will indicate the number of the column containing gene names.
For example, in the previous dataset, the function \textbf{DATAplotExpressionGenes()} must be called with the following arguments:

<<ExampleParametersData, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE>>=
data("RawCounts_Leong2014_FISSIONsub500wt")
@


<<ExampleParameters, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
res.ex<-DATAplotExpressionGenes(ExprData=RawCounts_Leong2014_FISSIONsub500wt,
                                Vector.row.gene=c(2),
                                Column.gene=1,
                                Group.position=NULL,
                                Time.position=2,
                                Individual.position=3,
                                Color.Group=NULL,
                                Plot.Expression=FALSE,
                                path.result=NULL)
@

Here, the argument \texttt{Column.gene=1} means that the first column of the dataset contain genes name, \texttt{Time.position=2} means that the time of measurements is between the first and the second underscores in the columns names, \texttt{Individual.position=3} means that the name of the individual is between the second and the third underscores in the columns names and
\texttt{Group.position=NULL} means that there is only one biological condition in the dataset.
Similarly, \texttt{Time.position=NULL} would mean that there is only one time of measurement for each individual and \texttt{Column.gene=NULL} would mean that there is no column containing gene names.

\subsection{Normalization with DATAnormalization()}\label{sec:DATAnormalization}

\subsubsection{Mouse data (case 1)}\label{sec:DATAnormalizationMus1}

In this section we use the mouse subdataset \textbf{RawCounts\_Antoszewski2022\_MOUSEsub500} (see the subsection \ref{sec:dataAntoszewski2022}) in order to explain \textbf{DATAnormalization()} in \textbf{Case 1}.

The following lines of code realize the normalization step.

<<NormalizationMouse, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE>>=
res.Norm.Mus500<-DATAnormalization(RawCounts=RawCounts_Antoszewski2022_MOUSEsub500,
                                   Column.gene=1,
                                   Group.position=1,
                                   Time.position=NULL,
                                   Individual.position=2,
                                   Normalization="rle",
                                   Blind.rlog.vst=FALSE,
                                   Plot.Boxplot=FALSE,
                                   Colored.By.Factors=TRUE,
                                   Color.Group=NULL,
                                   path.result=NULL)
@


If \Rcode{Plot.Boxplot=TRUE} a boxplot showing the distribution of the normalized expression (\texttt{Normalization="rle"} means that the rle method is used) of genes for each sample, is returned as shown below (Figure \ref{Mouse1Boxplot}).

\begin{figure}

\caption{Boxplot of the distribution of the rle normalized expression of genes for each sample.}
\label{Mouse1Boxplot}
\end{figure}

If \texttt{Colored.By.Factors=TRUE}, the color of the boxplots would be different for different biological conditions.
By default (if \texttt{Color.Group=NULL}), a color will be automatically applied for each biological condition. Colors can be changed the colors by creating the following data.frame

<<NormalizationMouseColor, eval=TRUE>>=
data.col.mus50<-data.frame(Name=c("N1wtT1wt","N1haT1wt","N1haT1ko","N1wtT1ko"),
                           Col=c("black","red","green","blue"))
@

and setting \texttt{Color.Group=data.col.mus50}.\newline

For more details on the use of the inputs \texttt{Column.gene}, \texttt{Time.position}, \texttt{Group.position} and \texttt{Individual.position}, see Section \nameref{sec:StructureDataset}.

The x-labels correspond to the new name of the samples which are just biological information, time information and individual information separated by a dot. If the user wants to see the 6th first rows of the normalized data, he can write in his console \texttt{head(res.Norm.Mus500, n=6)}.

The user can save the graph in a folder thanks to the input path.result. If \texttt{path.result=NULL} the results will still be plotted but not saved in a folder.\newline

Write \texttt{?DATAnormalization} in your console for more information about the function.

\subsubsection{Fission data (case 2)}\label{sec:DATAnormalizationFission}

In this section we use the fission yeast subdataset \textbf{RawCounts\_Leong2014\_FISSIONsub500wt} (see the subsection \nameref{sec:dataLeong2014}) in order to explain \textbf{DATAnormalization} in \textbf{case 2}.

<<NormalizationFission, eval=TRUE>>=
res.Norm.Yeast500<-DATAnormalization(RawCounts=RawCounts_Leong2014_FISSIONsub500wt,
                                     Column.gene=1,

\end{figure}

If \texttt{Colored.By.Factors=TRUE}, the color of the boxplots would be different for different time points. In case 2, the option \texttt{Color.Group} is not used.
The x-labels indicate time information and individual information separated by a dot.

For more details on the use of the inputs \texttt{Column.gene}, \texttt{Time.position}, \texttt{Group.position} and \texttt{Individual.position}, see Section \nameref{sec:StructureDataset}.

If the user wants to see the 10 first rows of the normalized data, he can write in his console \texttt{head(res.Norm.Yeast500, n=10)}.

The user chooses the path of the folder where the graph can be saved.
If \texttt{path.result=NULL}, results are plotted but not saved.\newline

The previous lines of code allow to plot for each biological condition: the evolution of the 25th gene expression of the three replicates across time and the evolution of the mean and the standard deviation of the 25th gene expression across time. The color of the different lines are different for different biological conditions.

The graphs are
\begin{itemize}
\item displayed if \texttt{Plot.Expression=TRUE}
\item saved in a folder if the user selects a folder path in \texttt{path.result}. If \texttt{path.result=NULL} the results will not be saved in a folder.

and setting \texttt{Color.Group=data.col.Leuk}.

If the user wants to select several genes, for instance the 97th, the 192th, the 194th and the 494th, he needs to set \texttt{Vector.row.gene=c(97,192,194,494)}.

In this section we use the mouse subdataset \textbf{RawCounts\_Antoszewski2022\_MOUSEsub500} (see the subsection \nameref{sec:dataAntoszewski2022}) in order to explain \textbf{DEanalysisGlobal()} in \textbf{case 1}.

The following commented lines of code realize the DE analysis.

The lines are commented because they take too much time. Uncomment them in order to use the function \texttt{DEanalysisGlobal()}.
\texttt{Results\_DEanalysis\_sub500} contains the results of \texttt{DEanalysisGlobal()} of three dataset which included \texttt{RawCounts\_Antoszewski2022\_MOUSEsub500}. The results of \texttt{DEanalysisGlobal()} with \texttt{RawCounts\_Antoszewski2022\_MOUSEsub500} are saved in \texttt{Results\_DEanalysis\_sub500\$DE\_Antoszewski2022\_MOUSEsub500}.


The function above

\begin{itemize}
\item returns a data.frame (output \texttt{DE.results}). See Subection \nameref{sec:DEanalysisMus1Summary}
\item plots the following graphs
%
\begin{itemize}
\item an upset graph, realized with the R package UpSetR \cite{Conway2017UpSetR}, which corresponds to a Venn diagram barplot. If there are only two biological conditions, the graph will not be plotted. See subsection \nameref{sec:VennBarplotBC}
\item a barplot showing the number of specific genes per biological condition. See Subection \nameref{sec:DEspecificBC}.

\item displayed if \texttt{Plot.DE.graph=TRUE}
\item saved in a folder if the user selects a folder path in \texttt{path.result}. If \texttt{path.result=NULL} the results will not be saved in a folder.
\end{itemize}

The data.frame and graphs are described in the following sub-sections.

Write \texttt{?DEanalysisGlobal} in your console for more information about the function.

\subsubsubsection{Data.frame summarising all the DE analysis (case 1)}
\label{sec:DEanalysisMus1Summary}

The output data.frame \texttt{DE.results} can be observed with the following lines of code,

<<DEresultsMouse1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE>>=
Res.DE.results.Mus1<-ResDEMus500$DE.results
@

as the glossary of the column names with

<<GlossaryMouse1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE>>=
ResGlossary.Mus1<-ResDEMus500$List.Glossary
@

and then write \texttt{Res.DE.results.Mus1} and \texttt{ResGlossary.Mus1} in the R console.

The data.frame contains

\begin{itemize}
\item gene names
\item pvalues, log2 fold change and DE genes between each pairs of biological conditions.
\item a binary column (1 and 0) where 1 means the gene is DE between at least one pair of biological conditions.
\item \(N_{bc}=4\) binary columns (with \(N_{bc}\) the number of biological conditions), which give the genes specific for each biological condition. A '1' in one of these columns means the gene is specific to the biological condition associated to the given column. 0 otherwise. A gene is called specific to a given biological condition BC1, if the gene is DE between BC1 and any other biological conditions, but not DE between any pair of other biological conditions.
\item \(N_{bc}=4\) columns filled with -1, 0 and 1, one per biological condition. A '1' in one of these columns means the gene is up-regulated (or over-expressed) for the biological condition associated to the given column. A gene is called up-regulated for a given biological condition BC1 if the gene is specific to the biological condition BC1 and expressions in BC1 are higher than in the other biological conditions. A '-1' in one of these columns means the gene is down-regulated (or under-expressed) for the biological condition associated to the given column. A gene is called down-regulated for a given biological condition BC1 if the gene is specific to the biological condition BC1 and expressions in BC1 are lower than in the other biological conditions. A '0' in one of these columns means the gene is not specific to the biological condition associated to the given column.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Number of genes per intersection of pairs of biological conditions}
\label{sec:VennBarplotBC}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.75\textheight]{MultiRNAflowImage/Mouse1_2-2DE_VennBarplot.pdf}
\caption{Number of DE genes corresponding to each possible intersection}
\label{fig:Mouse1UpsetBiocond}
\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse1UpsetBiocond}) plots the number of genes corresponding to each possible intersection in a Venn barplot. We say that

\begin{itemize}
\item a set of pairs of biological conditions forms an intersection when there is at least one gene which is DE for each of these pairs of biological conditions, but not for the others.
\item a gene corresponds to a given intersection if this genes is DE for each pair of biological conditions in the intersection, but not for the others.
\end{itemize}

For instance, the second column gives the number of genes corresponding to the intersection
\[\biggl\{\{\mbox{N1wtT1wt, N1haT1wt}\},
\{\mbox{N1wtT1wt, N1haT1ko}\},
\{\mbox{N1wtT1wt, N1wtT1ko}\}\biggl\} \ .\]
In other words, this is the number of genes DE between

\begin{itemize}
\item N1wtT1wt versus N1haT1wt
\item N1wtT1wt versus N1haT1ko
\item N1wtT1wt versus N1wtT1ko
\end{itemize}

and not DE between any other pair of biological conditions. Note that this columns actually gives the number of specific genes to the biological condition N1wtT1wt.


\subsubsubsection{Specific genes of a biological condition}\label{sec:DEspecificBC}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.75\textheight]{MultiRNAflowImage/Mouse1_2-2DE_NumberSpecificAndNoSpe_perBC.pdf}
\caption{Number of Up-regulated genes, down-regulated genes et no specific genes per biological condition}
\label{fig:MouseSpeNspe}
\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:MouseSpeNspe}) plots for each biological condition BC1

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of up- and down-regulated genes which are specific to the biological condition BC1.
\item The number of genes categorized as ``Other.'' A gene belongs to the ``Other'' category if it is DE between BC1 and at least one other biological condition and not specific.
\end{itemize}

The same graph without ``Other'' will be plotted too. If there are only two biological condition, only the second barplot will be plotted.

\subsubsection{Fission data (case 2)}\label{sec:DEanalysisFission}

In this section we use the fission yeast subdataset \textbf{RawCounts\_Leong2014\_FISSIONsub500wt} (see the subsection \nameref{sec:dataAntoszewski2022}) in order to explain \textbf{DEanalysisGlobal()} in \textbf{case 2}.

The following commented lines of code realize the DE analysis.

<<DEanalysisFISSION, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE>>=
# DEyeast500wt<-DEanalysisGlobal(RawCounts=RawCounts_Leong2014_FISSIONsub500wt,

data("Results_DEanalysis_sub500")
DEyeast500wt<-Results_DEanalysis_sub500$DE_Leong2014_FISSIONsub500wt
@

The lines are commented because they take too much time. Uncomment them in order to use the function \Rfunction{DEanalysisGlobal()}.
\texttt{Results\_DEanalysis\_sub500} contains the results of \Rfunction{DEanalysisGlobal()} of three dataset which included \texttt{RawCounts\_Leong2014\_FISSIONsub500wt}. The results of \Rfunction{DEanalysisGlobal()} with \texttt{RawCounts\_Leong2014\_FISSIONsub500wt} are saved in \texttt{Results\_DEanalysis\_sub500\$DE\_Leong2014\_FISSIONsub500wt}.

The function above

\begin{itemize}
\item returns a data.frame (output \texttt{DE.results}). See Subsection \nameref{sec:DEanalysisFissionSummary}
\item plots the following graphs
%
\begin{itemize}
\item an alluvial graph. See Subsection \nameref{sec:DEfissionAlluvial}
\item a graph showing the number of DE genes as a function of time for each temporal group. By temporal group, we mean the sets of genes which are first DE at the same time. See Subsection \nameref{sec:DEfissionNbDEperTemporalGroup}
\item a barplot showing the number of DE genes (up- or down-regulated) for each time. See Subsection \nameref{fig:YeastNumberDEperTime}.
\item two upset graphs, realized with the R package UpSetR \cite{Conway2017UpSetR}, showing the number of DE genes belonging to each DE temporal pattern. By temporal pattern, we mean the set of times ti such that the gene is DE between ti and the reference time t0. See Subsection \nameref{sec:NumberDEperTemporalPattern}.
\end{itemize}
%
\end{itemize}

The graphs are
\begin{itemize}
\item displayed if \texttt{Plot.DE.graph=TRUE}
\item saved in a folder if the user selects a folder path in \texttt{path.result}. If \texttt{path.result=NULL} the results will not be saved in a folder.
\end{itemize}

The data.frame and graphs are described in the following sub-sections.

Write \texttt{?DEanalysisGlobal} in your console for more information about the function.

\subsubsubsection{Data.frame summarising all the DE analysis (case 2)}
\label{sec:DEanalysisFissionSummary}

The output data.frame \texttt{DE.results} can be observed with the following lines of code,

<<DEresultsFission, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE>>=
Res.DE.results.Fission<-DEyeast500wt$DE.results
@

as the glossary of the column names with

<<GlossaryFission, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE>>=
ResGlossary.Fission<-DEyeast500wt$List.Glossary
@

and then write \texttt{Res.DE.results.Fission} and \texttt{ResGlossary.Fission} in the R console.

The data.frame contains

\begin{itemize}
\item gene names
\item pvalues, log2 fold change and DE genes between each time ti versus the reference time t0.
\item a binary column (1 and 0) where 1 means the gene is DE at at least between one time ti versus the reference time t0.
\item a column where each element is succession of 0 and 1. The positions of `1' indicate the set of times ti such that the gene is DE between ti and the reference time t0. So each element of the column is what we called previously, a temporal pattern.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection{Alluvial graph of genes which are DE at at least one time ti versus the reference time t0}
\label{sec:DEfissionAlluvial}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.75\textheight]{MultiRNAflowImage/Fission_2-2DE_AlluvialGraph.pdf}
\caption{Alluvial graph of genes which are DE at at least one time ti versus the reference time t0}
\label{fig:YeastAlluvial}
\end{figure}

The x-axis of the graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:YeastAlluvial}) is labeled with all times except t0. For each vertical barplot, there are two strata: 1 and 0 whose sizes indicate respectively the number of DE genes and of non DE genes, between the time corresponding to the barplot and the reference time t0.

The alluvial graph (Figure~\ref{fig:YeastAlluvial}) is composed of curves each corresponding to a single gene, which are gathered in alluvia. An alluvium is composed of all genes having the same curve: for example, an alluvium going from the stratum 0 at time t1 (for instance) to the stratum 1 at time t2 corresponds to the set of genes which are not differentially expressed (DE) at t1 and are DE at time t2.
Each alluvium connects pairs of consecutive barplots and its thickness gives the number of genes in the set.

The color of each alluvium indicates the temporal group, defined as the set of genes which are all first DE at the same time with respect to the reference time t0.

\subsubsubsection{Number of DE genes per time for each temporal group}
\label{sec:DEfissionNbDEperTemporalGroup}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.75\textheight]{MultiRNAflowImage/Fission_2-2DE_NumberDEgenes_perTemporalGroup.pdf}
\caption{Number of DE genes per time for each temporal group}
\label{fig:YeastDePerTemporalGroup}
\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:YeastDePerTemporalGroup}) plots the time evolution of the number of DE genes within each temporal group.

The x-axis labels indicate all times except t0.

\subsubsubsection{Number of DE genes up-regulated and down-regulated per time}
\label{sec:DEfissionUpDown}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.75\textheight]{MultiRNAflowImage/Fission_2-2DE_NumberUpDownRegulated_perTime.pdf}
\caption{Number of DE genes per time.}
\label{fig:YeastNumberDEperTime}
\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:YeastNumberDEperTime}) shows the number of DE genes per time.

The x-axis labels indicate all times except t0.

For each DE gene, we compute the sign of the log2 fold change between time ti and time t0. If the sign is positive (resp. negative), the gene is categorized as up-regulated (resp. down-regulated). In the graph, the up-regulated (resp. down-regulated) genes are indicated in red (resp. in blue).

\paragraph{Number of DE genes belonging to each DE temporal pattern}
\label{sec:NumberDEperTemporalPattern}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth,height=0.75\textheight]{MultiRNAflowImage/Fission_2-2DE_VennBarplot_NumberUpRegulated.pdf}
\caption{Number of DE genes per time.}
\label{fig:YeastDeUpsetTime}
\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:YeastDeUpsetTime}), realized with the R package UpSetR \cite{Conway2017UpSetR}, plots the number of genes in each DE temporal pattern in a Venn barplot.
By DE temporal pattern, we mean a subset of times in t1,\ldots,tn. We say that a gene belongs to a DE temporal pattern if the gene is DE versus t0 only at the times in this DE temporal patterns.

For each gene in a given DE temporal pattern, we compute the number of DE times where it is up-regulated and we use a color code in the Venn barplot to indicate the number of genes in a temporal pattern that are up-regulated a given number of times.

The same graph is also given without colors.

\subsubsection{Leukemia data (case 3 with only two biological conditions)}
\label{sec:DEanalysisLeuk}

In this section we use the Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) subdataset\newline \textbf{RawCounts\_Schleiss2021\_CLLsub500} (see Subsection \nameref{sec:dataSchleiss2021}) in order to explain \textbf{DEanalysisGlobal()} in \textbf{case 3} when there only two biological conditions.

\caption{Alluvial graph of genes which are DE at at least one time ti versus the reference time t0, for the biological condition P}
\label{fig:LeukAlluvialP}
\end{figure}

The x-axis of the graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:LeukAlluvialP}) is labeled with all times except t0. For each vertical barplot, there are two strata: 1 and 0 whose sizes indicate respectively the number of DE genes and of non DE genes, between the time corresponding to the barplot and the reference time t0.

The alluvial graph (Figure~\ref{fig:LeukAlluvialP}) is composed of curves each corresponding to a single gene, which are gathered in alluvia. An alluvium is composed of all genes having the same curve: for example, an alluvium going from the stratum 0 at time t1 (for instance) to the stratum 1 at time t2 corresponds to the set of genes which are not differentially expressed (DE) at t1 and are DE at time t2.
Each alluvium connects pairs of consecutive barplots and its thickness gives the number of genes in the set.

The color of each alluvium indicates the temporal group, defined as the set of genes which are all first DE at the same time with respect to the reference time t0.

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:LeukDePerTemporalGroupP}) plots the time evolution of the number of DE genes within each temporal group, for the biological condition P.

The x-axis labels indicate all times except t0.

\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:LeukNumberDEperTimePerBC}) shows the number of DE genes per time, for each biological condition.

The x-axis labels indicate all times except t0.

For each DE gene, we compute the sign of the log2 fold change between time ti and time t0. If the sign is positive (resp. negative), the gene is categorized as up-regulated (resp. down-regulated). In the graph, the up-regulated (resp. down-regulated) genes are indicated in red (resp. in blue).

\caption{Number of DE genes per temporal pattern, for the biological condition P.}
\label{fig:LeukDeUpSetP}
\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:LeukDeUpSetP}), realized with the R package UpSetR \cite{Conway2017UpSetR}, plots the number of genes in each DE temporal pattern in a Venn barplot.
By DE temporal pattern, we mean a subset of times in t1,\ldots,tn. We say that a gene belongs to a DE temporal pattern if the gene is DE versus t0 only at the times in this DE temporal patterns.

For each gene in a given DE temporal pattern, we compute the number of DE times where it is up-regulated and we use a color code in the Venn barplot to indicate the number of genes in a temporal pattern that are up-regulated a given number of times.

The same graph is also given without colors.

\subsubsubsection{Alluvial graph for DE genes which are DE at at least one time for each group (case 3, 2 BC)}

The figure~\ref{fig:LeukDESpecificSignature1TimeMnimum} summarizes well the combination of temporal and biological analysis because the figure gives for each biological condition the number of genes which are DE at at least one time, the number of specific genes at at least one time and the number of signature at at least one time.

The x-axis of the graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse2AlluvialBmKo}) is labeled with all times except t0. For each vertical barplot, there are two strata: 1 and 0 whose sizes indicate respectively the number of DE genes and of non DE genes, between the time corresponding to the barplot and the reference time t0.

The alluvial graph (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse2AlluvialBmKo}) is composed of curves each corresponding to a single gene, which are gathered in alluvia. An alluvium is composed of all genes having the same curve: for example, an alluvium going from the stratum 0 at time t1 (for instance) to the stratum 1 at time t2 corresponds to the set of genes which are not differentially expressed (DE) at t1 and are DE at time t2.
Each alluvium connects pairs of consecutive barplots and its thickness gives the number of genes in the set.

The color of each alluvium indicates the temporal group, defined as the set of genes which are all first DE at the same time with respect to the reference time t0.

\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse2DeUpsetTimeBmKo}), realized with the R package UpSetR \cite{Conway2017UpSetR}, plots the number of genes in each DE temporal pattern in a Venn barplot.
By DE temporal pattern, we mean a subset of times in t1,\ldots,tn. We say that a gene belongs to a DE temporal pattern if the gene is DE versus t0 only at the times in this DE temporal patterns.

For each gene in a given DE temporal pattern, we compute the number of DE times where it is up-regulated and we use a color code in the Venn barplot to indicate the number of genes in a temporal pattern that are up-regulated a given number of times.

The same graph is also given without colors.

\caption{Number of DE genes corresponding to each possible intersection}
\label{fig:Mouse2UpsetBiocondt0}
\end{figure}

The graph above (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse2UpsetBiocondt0}) plots the number of genes corresponding to each possible intersection in a Venn barplot at time t0. This graph is plotted only when the number of biological conditions is stricty higer than two.

We say that

\begin{itemize}
\item a set of pairs of biological conditions forms an intersection at a given time ti when there is at least one gene which is DE for each of these pairs of biological conditions at time ti, but not for the others at time ti.
\item a gene corresponds to a given intersection if this genes is DE for each pair of biological conditions in the intersection at time ti, but not for the others at time ti.
\end{itemize}

For instance, the first column gives the number of genes corresponding to the intersection
%
\[\biggl\{\{\mbox{BmWt, BmKo}\},
\{\mbox{CrWt, BmKo}\},
\{\mbox{CrKo, BmKo}\}\biggl\} \ .\]
at time t0. In other words, this is the number of genes DE between

\begin{itemize}
\item BmWt versus BmKo
\item CrWt versus BmKo
\item CrKo versus BmKo
\end{itemize}

and not DE between any other pair of biological conditions at time t0.

Note that this columns actually gives the number of specific genes to the biological condition BmKo at time t0.

\begin{itemize}
\item The number of up- and down-regulated genes which are specific to the biological condition BC1, for each time ti.
\item The number of genes categorized as ``Other.'' A gene belongs to the ``Other'' category if it is DE between BC1 and at least one other biological condition at time ti and not specific at time ti.
\end{itemize}

The same graph without ``Other'' will be plotted too. If there are only two biological condition, only the second barplot will be plotted.

\label{sec:GOenrichment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Mouse data (case 1)}\label{sec:GOenrichmentMus1}

In this section we use the mouse subdataset \textbf{RawCounts\_Antoszewski2022\_MOUSEsub500} (see the subsection \nameref{sec:dataAntoszewski2022}) in order to explain \textbf{GSEAQuickAnalysis()} and \textbf{GSEApreprocessing()} in \textbf{case 1}.

\subsubsubsection{Gene ontology with the R package gprofiler2}
\label{sec:GOenrichmentMus1Gprofiler2}

The following lines of code realize an enrichment analysis with the R package gprofiler2 for a selection of genes.
Beware, an internet connection is needed.

<<GSEAquickAnalysis_Mus, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE>>=
resGSEAgprofiler2Mus<-GSEAQuickAnalysis(Internect.Connection=FALSE,
                                        Res.DE.analysis=ResDEMus500,
                                        ColumnsCriteria=2,
                                        ColumnsLog2ordered=NULL,
                                        Set.Operation="union",
                                        Organism="mmusculus",
                                        MaxNumberGO=10,
                                        Background=FALSE,
                                        Display.plots=FALSE,

#
# head(resGSEAgprofiler2Mus$GSEAresults)
@

As \textbf{GSEAQuickAnalysis()} requires an internet connection, the input \texttt{Internect.Connection} is set by default to \texttt{FALSE}.
Once the user is sure to have an internet connection, the user may set \texttt{Internect.Connection=TRUE} in order to realize the enrichment analysis.

The subset of genes is selected as follow

\begin{enumerate}
\item the user select one or more binary column with the input \texttt{ColumnsCriteria} which corresponds to the column number of \texttt{ResDEMus500\$DE.results}
\item Then the subset of genes will be
\begin{itemize}
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="union"} then the subset genes are those such that the sum of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="intersect"} then the subset genes are those such that the product of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="setdiff"} then the subset genes are those such that only one element of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


If \texttt{ColumnsLog2ordered} is a vector of integers, it corresponds to the columns number of \texttt{Res.DE.analysis\$DE.results}, the output of \Rfunction{DEanalysisGlobal()}, which must contains \(log_2\) fold change values. The rows of \texttt{Res.DE.analysis\$DE.results} (corresponding to genes) will be decreasingly ordered according to the sum of absolute \(log_2\) fold change (the selected columns must contain \(log_2\) fold change values) before the enrichment analysis. The enrichment analysis will take into account the genes order as the first genes will be considered to have the highest biological importance and the last genes the lowest.

The function returns

\begin{itemize}
\item a data.frame (output \texttt{resGSEAgprofiler2Mus\$GSEAresults}) giving information about all detected gene ontologies the list of associated genes.
\item a lollipop graph (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse1Lollipop}). The y-axis indicates the \texttt{MaxNumberGO} most significant gene ontologies and pathways associated to the selected DE genes. The gene ontologies and patways are sorted into descending order. The x-axis indicates the -log10(pvalues). The higher is a lollipop the more significant is a gene ontology or pathway. A lollipop is yellow if the pvalues is smaller than 0.05 (significant) and blue otherwise.
\item A mahattan plot (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse1Manhattan}) indicating all genes ontologies ordered according to the functional database (G0::BP, G0::CC, G0::MF and KEGG)

The subset of genes is selected as follow

\begin{enumerate}
\item the user select one or more binary column with the input \texttt{ColumnsCriteria} which corresponds to the column number of \texttt{ResDELeuk500\$DE.results}
\item Then the subset of genes will be
%
\begin{itemize}
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="union"} then the subset genes are those such that the sum of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="intersect"} then the subset genes are those such that the product of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="setdiff"} then the subset genes are those such that only one element of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\end{itemize}
%
\end{enumerate}


If the user wants to save the files, the input \texttt{Save.plots} must be

\begin{itemize}
\item either \texttt{Save.plots=TRUE}, and the graph will be saved in the same location than the input \texttt{path.result} of the function \Rfunction{DEanalysisGlobal()}.
\item either a strings of characters giving the path to a folder where the graphs will be saved. The user then choose the path of the folder where results can be saved.

\subsubsection{Mouse data 2 (case 3 with more than two biological conditions)}
\label{sec:GOenrichmentMus2}

In this section we use the mouse subdataset \textbf{RawCounts\_Weger2021\_MOUSEsub500} (see Subsection \nameref{sec:dataWeger2021}) in order to explain \textbf{GSEAQuickAnalysis()} and \textbf{GSEApreprocessing()} in \textbf{case 3} when there are more than two biological conditions.

\subsubsubsection{Gene ontology with the R package gprofiler2}
\label{sec:GOenrichmentMus2Gprofiler2}

The following lines of code realize an enrichment analysis with the R package gprofiler2 for a selection of genes.
Beware, an internet connection is needed.


<<GSEAquickAnalysis_Mouse2, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE>>=
resGSEAgprofiler2Mouse2<-GSEAQuickAnalysis(Internect.Connection=FALSE,
                                           Res.DE.analysis=ResDEMusBmCrKoWt500,
                                           ColumnsCriteria=2:5,
                                           ColumnsLog2ordered=NULL,
                                           Set.Operation="union",
                                           Organism="mmusculus",
                                           MaxNumberGO=20,
                                           Background=FALSE,
                                           Display.plots=FALSE,
                                           Save.plots=FALSE)
#
# head(resGSEAgprofiler2Mouse2$GSEAresults)
@

As \textbf{GSEAQuickAnalysis()} requires an internet connection, the input \texttt{Internect.Connection} is set by default to \texttt{FALSE}.
Once the user is sure to have an internet connection, the user may set \texttt{Internect.Connection=TRUE} in order to realize the enrichment analysis.

The subset of genes is selected as follow

\begin{enumerate}
\item the user select one or more binary column with the input \texttt{ColumnsCriteria} which corresponds to the column number of \texttt{resGSEAgprofiler2Mouse2\$DE.results}
\item Then the subset of genes will be
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="union"} then the subset genes are those such that the sum of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="intersect"} then the subset genes are those such that the product of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\item If \texttt{Set.Operation="setdiff"} then the subset genes are those such that only one element of the selected columns in \texttt{Res.DE.analysis} is >0.
\end{itemize}

If \texttt{ColumnsLog2ordered} is a vector of integers, it corresponds to the columns number of \texttt{Res.DE.analysis\$DE.results}, the output of \Rfunction{DEanalysisGlobal()}, which must contains \(log_2\) fold change values. The rows of \texttt{Res.DE.analysis\$DE.results} (corresponding to genes) will be decreasingly ordered according to the sum of absolute \(log_2\) fold change (the selected columns must contain \(log_2\) fold change values) before the enrichment analysis. The enrichment analysis will take into account the genes order as the first genes will be considered to have the highest biological importance and the last genes the lowest.

\label{fig:Mouse2Manhattan}
\end{figure}

The function returns

\begin{itemize}
\item a data.frame (output \texttt{resGSEAgprofiler2Mouse2\$GSEAresults}) giving information about all detected gene ontologies the list of associated genes.
\item a lollipop graph (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse2Lollipop}). The y-axis indicates the \texttt{MaxNumberGO} most significant gene ontologies and pathways associated to the selected DE genes. The gene ontologies and patways are sorted into descending order. The x-axis indicates the -log10(pvalues). The higher is a lollipop the more significant is a gene ontology or pathway. A lollipop is yellow if the pvalues is smaller than 0.05 (significant) and blue otherwise.
\item A mahattan plot (Figure~\ref{fig:Mouse2Manhattan}) indicating all genes ontologies ordered according to the functional database (G0::BP, G0::CC, G0::MF and KEGG)
\end{itemize}

If the user wants to save the graphs, the input \texttt{Save.plots} must be

\begin{itemize}
\item either \texttt{Save.plots=TRUE}, and the graph will be saved in the same location than the input \texttt{path.result} of the function \Rfunction{DEanalysisGlobal()}.
\item either a strings of characters giving the path to a folder where the graphs will be saved. The user then choose the path of the folder where results can be saved.
